# FNF-LegacyToLive
Convert old legacy charts to the 0.5 version of the game.

## How to use
Go to the releases and download the program, then run it. Paste in the folder making sure there are only 3 .json files in there (otherwise it will break), no more, no less.

And boom it should convert it, have fun!!!
